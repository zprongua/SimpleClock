# SimpleClock

THis is a simple Java desktop clock app.

Starting with the code as is, make additions to it to increase its functionality.

## Additions

- Modify this to use a Thread rather than an infinite loop. (see line 54 in SimpleClock.java)
- Make the UI look better; increase margins
- Add a button which switches between 12/24 hr format
- Add a button which switches between local time and GMT
